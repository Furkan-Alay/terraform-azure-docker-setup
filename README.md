# ðŸš€ Cloud Infrastructure Automation with Terraform and Docker on Azure

## 1. Requirements

To complete this project, make sure the following tools and accounts are available and properly set up on your system:

- âœ… **Terraform** â€“ Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning resources
- âœ… **Azure CLI** â€“ Command-line interface to interact with Azure
- âœ… **Azure Account** â€“ Active Azure subscription with sufficient privileges
- âœ… **Docker Desktop & Docker Compose** â€“ To run containerized services locally or on remote VMs
- âœ… **Any Terminal** â€“ To run CLI Command (Gitbash,VsCode,Notebook,etc.)

## 2. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate hands-on DevOps skills by automating the deployment of infrastructure and services on Microsoft Azure. This includes:

- Provisioning a Debian-based virtual machine using Terraform
- Installing and configuring Docker and Docker Compose
- Deploying Nginx Proxy Manager and IT Tools as containerized applications
- Managing application access via domain or local hosts configuration
- Ensuring modular and reusable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) structure

This setup reflects real-world practices in cloud infrastructure management and container orchestration.
